# My custom st build
My custom build of suckless simple terminal for my Linux install. I've decided to give a try to a suckless software with my Linux installation and I will document the process here.

# Applied patches
In this section I will list all the patches that I use for my simple terminal build:

* Alpha - patch used for transparency effect.
* Scrollback - patch for scrollback through terminal with Shift + PgUp/PgDn keys.
* Scrollback-mouse - patch for scrolling through the terminal with Shift + Mousewheel.
* Scrollback-mouse-altscreen - patch for scrolling trough the terminal with Mouse only.
* w3m - for displaying image previews within terminal-based file manager. Although I'm not sure if this was necessary as within `Ranger` file manager image previews did not display while using `w3m`, but when I've switched to `ueberzug` for previewing images, they started to show up in `ranger`.
